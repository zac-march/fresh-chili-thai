## Fresh Chili Thai - Website Makeover

Fresh Chili Thai is one of my favourite Thai restaurants, but their website didn't reflect the quality of their food and services. As a web developer, I decided to take on the challenge of giving their website a much-needed makeover.<br><br>The goal of the project was to redesign the Fresh Chili Thai website to improve the user experience, attract new customers, and ultimately increase business for the restaurant. The new design is visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive across all devices.
